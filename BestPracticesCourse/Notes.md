# Naming and handling classes

1. Use PascalCasing as always for classes, properties, **Meaningful**
2. Use camelCase for parameters
3. Don't be convuluted
4. Choose Private if possible (tests needs public)
5. **Use ///** Except if very obvious, useful for intelisense
6. *propfull*

7. One class per code file
8. No Large Classes!

## Constructor

1. *ctor*
2. constructor, use this() for calling the constructor without parameters (Actor Class), avoids repeated code
3. *testm*
