.NET Core 3.1 MVC REST API - Full Course

From https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmvcAzHpsk8


## Notes
- Would be better with C# Extensions
- Missing Unit Tests in video
- Check the AddSingleton, AddScope, Transient.
- See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38138100/addtransient-addscoped-and-addsingleton-services-differences

## More Notes

- DI will let me decouple implementation of repository
- code -r <folder>
- intellisense over a not implemented Interface can scaffold all methods
